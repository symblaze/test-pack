# Symblaze Test Pack

Whenever you write a new line of code, you should write a test for it. The Symfony test pack is quite good,
but it's not so easy to keep your test suite organized and clean. This package aims to help you with:

1. Organizing your tests in way that mirrors your code structure.
2. Stop thinking about which base class to extend. A single base class to extend for all your tests.
3. A rich set of assertions to make your tests more readable.
